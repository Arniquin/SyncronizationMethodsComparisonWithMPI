# SyncronizationMethodsComparisonWithMPI
This project evaluates the efficiency of various synchronization methods in Java using a simulation of water tanks. The tanks are managed by two producer threads and two consumer threads running in parallel. Each tank employs a different synchronization approach, allowing for a comparative analysis of performance and applicability.
